[introduction]
= Introduction

Customer service is a RESTful web service for creating and storing customers. It uses hypermedia
to describe the relationships between resources and to allow navigation between them.

== Running the service
The customer service is written using http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot] which
makes it easy to get it up and running so that you can start exploring the REST API.

The first step is to clone the Git repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://user@bitbucket.org/motabilitydiscovery/customer-service.git
----

Once the clone is complete, you're ready to get the service up and running:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd customer-service
$ gradlew.bat clean build
$ java -jar build/libs/customer-service-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

You can check that the service is up and running by executing a simple request using
cURL:

include::{snippets}/index/1/curl-request.adoc[]

This request should yield the following response in the
http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application Language (HAL)] format:

include::{snippets}/index/1/http-response.adoc[]

Note the `_links` in the JSON response. They are key to navigating the API.


[getting-started-creating-a-customer]
== Creating a Customer
Now that you've started the service and verified that it works, the next step is to use
it to create a new customer. As you saw above, the URI for working with customers is included as
a link when you perform a `GET` request against the root of the service:

include::{snippets}/index/1/http-response.adoc[]

To create a customer, you need to execute a `POST` request to this URI including a JSON
payload containing the customer details in the body:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-customer/1/curl-request.adoc[]

The response from this request should have a status code of `201 Created` and contain a
`Location` header whose value is the URI of the newly created customer:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-customer/1/http-response.adoc[]

To work with the newly created customer you use the URI in the `Location` header. For example,
you can access the customer's details by performing a `GET` request:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-customer/2/curl-request.adoc[]

This request will produce a response with the customer's details in its body:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-customer/2/http-response.adoc[]
