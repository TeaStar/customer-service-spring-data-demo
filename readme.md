# Customer Service

## Introduction

Customer service is a RESTful web service for creating and storing customers. It uses hypermedia to describe the relationships between resources and to allow navigation between them.

## Getting started

### Running the service
The customer service is written using [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot) & [Spring Data Rest](http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/) which makes it easy to get it up and running so that you can start exploring the REST API.

The first step is to clone the Git repository:

```
$ git clone https://user@bitbucket.org/motabilitydiscovery/customer-service.git
```

Once the clone is complete, you're ready to get the service up and running:

```
$ cd customer-service
$ gradlew.bat clean build
$ java -jar build/libs/customer-service-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The service port can be configured in the application.yml file.
```
server:
    port: 8080
```

## API Documentation
The customer service api documentation is generated by the 'Documentation Test' classes. Once the application has started the api documentation will be accessible at: http://localhost:8080/static/docs/index.html
